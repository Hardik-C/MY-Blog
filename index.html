          <p class="text-muted">Govardhan Hill, also called Mount Govardhana and Giriraj,
             is a sacred Hindu site in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, 
             India on an 8 km long hill located in the area of Govardhan and Radha Kund, 
             which is about 21 kilometres from Vrindavan.Why is Krishna called Govardhan?
             In the literal meaning, 'Go' translates to 'cows', and 'vardhana' translates to 'nourishment'. 
             Another meaning of 'Go' is 'the senses' and 'vardhana' can also mean 'to increase' - thus the 
             name is also translated by devotees of Krishna as 'that which increases the senses' 
             in their attraction to Krishna.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">Dolphin's Nose is a hill in Visakhapatnam between Yarada and Gangavaram Port. The hill is named Dolphin's Nose 
          because it resembles a dolphin's nose. It is a conspicuous land mark in Visakhapatnam. Dolphin's nose is a huge rocky head land which 
          is 174 meters high and 358 meters above sea level.</p>

        <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone 
          are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure
          definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination,
          humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero 
          movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may 
          be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. 

          The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart 
          writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best 
          blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with <b>Robert 
          Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans</b> in particular turning in some of the most human and 
          enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly 
          breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than
          he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie 
          villains of the last century.
          
          The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final 
          battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed.
          Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. 
          The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action.
          It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER 
          hear. 
          
          And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable,
          as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. 
          This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think 
          anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre.
          However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay 
          value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless 
          this is a superhero masterpiece!</p>

        <p>Marvel Studios’ “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” is the latest modern-day extension to the MCU?
          Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU 
          movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching
          this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure 
          toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy 
          blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly 
          heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, 
          as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. 
          The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, 
          and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film 
          divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn’t 
          need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first 
          showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily
          different formats including 4D-X.
